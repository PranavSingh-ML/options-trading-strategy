# Data Quality Issues Report

## Overview
This document outlines significant data quality issues discovered in the options trading database that prevent proper execution of the trading strategy.

## Problem Summary
The trading strategy requires morning session data (9:15 AM - 9:45 AM) for exit management on the day following trade entry. However, many option strikes have incomplete or missing morning session data, causing trade failures.

## Specific Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Morning Session Data
**Problem**: Many option strikes lack data during the critical 9:15-9:45 AM exit window.

**Examples from Failed Trades**:
- **04092023 → 05092023**: PE 44600 has only 6 records (10:53-14:22), **0 morning records**
- **07092023 → 08092023**: PE 44800 has 37 records (10:02-15:28), **0 morning records**  
- **14092023 → 15092023**: CE 46900 has 116 records (10:58-15:28), **0 morning records**

### 2. Inconsistent Data Coverage by Strike
**Problem**: Different strikes have vastly different data completeness levels.

**Pattern Observed**:
- Some strikes have full 375 records (complete trading day)
- Others have as few as 1-6 records for the entire day
- ATM and near-ATM strikes often missing morning data specifically

### 3. Time Coverage Gaps
**Analysis Results**:
- **Spot Data**: ✅ Complete (375 records, 9:15-15:29 for all dates)
- **Option Data**: ❌ Highly inconsistent across strikes
- **Morning Sessions**: ❌ Frequently missing for specific strikes

## Impact on Trading Strategy

### Trade Failures
The strategy fails when:
1. Main option strike lacks morning session data for exit management
2. Hedge option strike lacks morning session data for simultaneous exit
3. Both legs cannot be closed simultaneously due to missing data

### Failed Trade Cases
```
Case: 04092023 → 05092023 (PE)
├── Main strike 44600: 0 morning records ❌
└── Hedge strike 43700: 31 morning records ✅
Result: Trade fails due to missing main option exit data

Case: 12092023 → 13092023 (CE)  
├── Main strike 45500: 19 morning records ✅
└── Hedge strike 46400: 0 morning records ❌
Result: Trade fails due to missing hedge option exit data
```

## Data Quality Statistics

### Record Count Distribution
- **High Coverage Strikes**: 300-375 records per day
- **Medium Coverage Strikes**: 100-299 records per day  
- **Low Coverage Strikes**: 1-99 records per day (❌ Problematic)

### Strike Coverage Issues
- **Date 01092023**: 17 strikes with <100 records
- **Date 04092023**: 51 strikes with <100 records
- **Date 05092023**: 55 strikes with <100 records

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes
1. **Liquidity Issues**: Low-volume strikes may not trade in morning sessions
2. **Data Collection Gaps**: Incomplete data capture for specific contracts
3. **Market Microstructure**: Some strikes only become active later in the day
4. **Expiry Effects**: Near-expiry contracts may have irregular trading patterns

### Data Vendor Issues
The inconsistent coverage suggests potential issues with:
- Data feed reliability during market open
- Strike-specific data collection problems
- Incomplete historical data reconstruction

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Filter Strategy Scope**: Only trade strikes with verified morning session data
2. **Pre-validation**: Check data completeness before trade execution
3. **Fallback Logic**: Implement alternative exit mechanisms for data gaps

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Data Vendor Review**: Investigate data source reliability
2. **Alternative Data Sources**: Consider multiple data feeds for redundancy
3. **Market Hours Analysis**: Focus on high-liquidity periods and strikes

### Strategy Modifications
1. **Strike Selection**: Prioritize strikes with historical data completeness
2. **Exit Timing**: Consider alternative exit windows with better data coverage
3. **Position Sizing**: Adjust based on data quality scores

## Conclusion

The current database has significant data quality issues that prevent reliable strategy execution. Approximately **30-40% of potential trades fail** due to missing morning session data for either main or hedge option positions.

**Recommendation**: Address data quality issues before proceeding with live trading or consider this a limitation of the current dataset for backtesting purposes.
